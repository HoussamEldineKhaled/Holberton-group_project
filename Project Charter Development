0. The objective of the project is to make a website that fosters art appreciation and community 
engagement. Many people, especially in this day and age, want to express themselves and their hobbies
in spaces they consider safe, inclusive, and fun, so we endeavoured to make a website exactly like this
to support such endeavours. Our project's specific objectives are to foster community engagement and growth,
expression of skills, talents, and hobbies, and provide a safe environment for this expression, free from
judgment and bigotry, in an automated way.
