0. The result of our work is a website in which you can post videos, audio, and pictures of different pieces of art
for all users to see. The website will include a system where moderators and an automated algorithm will
monitor and control the posts posted per the community guidelines of the website. 
Lessons Learned: More bug fixes, more flexible working on both front-end and back-end, and better transparency.
1. The project is about making a website where users can post their artworks. The frontend was made with html css and js while the backend
used python flask, CORS, and SQLite3. The database was made using SQLite. Backend includes many different functionalities like signing up, logging in,
posting, liking, and commenting. The result was a fully working website with different functionalities. Future recommendations
would include implementing encryption for passwords and an automated system which does moderation.
2. The team was able to finish the project on time with a timely updates to the front end and the backend. Our main challenge is 
managing the time to continue with our code in addition to bugs in the backend. When we used postman,
the debugging of backend was much easier.
