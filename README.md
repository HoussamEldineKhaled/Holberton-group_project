reflection to the world through their art. The art would be shared through individual posts be certain users and can be in the form of an audio, a photo, a painting, a video, etc.
The website will be community driven, meaning that there will be no material profit from any of the posts and works displayed. The website will include community moderation to insure the
following of ethical rules in addition to an AI tool which will also enforce these rules. This website is aimed to encourage a creative community on all artistic endeavours, discussions of art between people, and
creative solidarity between users. Rules and conditions will be put in place in order to ensure a smooth and positive environment with in the wbesite. The impact of this is the potential revitalisation of artistic communities which
robust moderation both manual and automated.Finally, the team was formed of two people, Houssam Khaled and Mohammad Aoun, who will be working together and contact each other through WhatsApp for texting and calling
and github for code sharing.
